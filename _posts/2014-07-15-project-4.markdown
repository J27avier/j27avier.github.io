description:  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8885046">This project  as accepted to IEEE's MWSCAS 2019</a>. It consists of a motion coordination technique for an omnidirectional and a differential-drive robot. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; The strategy forms the follower robot relative to the leader robot using a local vision system for distance and heading angle measurement. The leader robot follows a desired trajectory in the plane while using a consensus approach to converge with the follower's angle. To evaluate the control strategy's effectiveness, we conducted experiments using two industrial-focused robots and a motion capture system.
