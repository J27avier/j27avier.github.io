title: Tracked Mobile Robot
description: This tracked robot has custom-designed mechanical, electrical, and control components. The robot has a differential configuration, featuring two DC motors equipped with encoders for providing precise feedback. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The body is constructed using laser-cut acrylic material and fitted with ready-made tracks. The robot can be remotely controlled using a mobile application, or it can navigate to a specific location autonomously via GPS. The control mechanisms utilize PID for manual control and state feedback for autonomous navigation.
