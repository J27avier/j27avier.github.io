title: Detecting Attacks on Federated Learning
description: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that facilitates joint training of a model without sharing local data. FL addresses privacy, security, access rights, and heterogeneous data issues. While this privacy-preserving technique has become increasingly popular, its distributed nature exposes new threats from malicious participants. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, I created heterogeneous datasets based on Fashion-MNIST, replicated and tested various attack detection techniques, and ran experiments that trained a Federated Convolutional Neural Network. Other team members contributed by implementing the attacks, implementing the models and configuring the GPU servers.
