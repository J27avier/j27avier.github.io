title: Robot Arm & Visual Control
category: Graduate Project (6 members)
tech: ROS, Python, RGBD Camera, Vision Trackers
description: A robot manipulator (WAM by Barrett Advance Robotics) is controlled in an Uncalibrated Visuals Servoing scheme where an RGBD Camera tracks the location of the end effector and the location of a target position. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My task consisted in designing a trajectory that connected the end effector to the final point with a smooth line in 3D space. That line was segmented into waypoints which were transmitted via ROS Publisher/Subscriber Nodes to the robot's control software. The controller only used visual feedback provided by the camera.
