title: Geotracking Alerts for Delivery Trucks 
description: As a component of a large multinational beverage company's operations monitoring platform, this project analyzed the GPS coordinates of their delivery vehicles. The GPS system posted the coordinates at regular intervals, allowing us to generate alerts whenever a vehicle visited a client, exceeded its visit time, entered a prohibited geofence, and other similar events. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project was deployed in Azure Databricks, and I was responsible for designing the code that identified each alert.
